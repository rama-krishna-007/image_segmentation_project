# Image Segmentation using OpenCV

This is a basic image segmentation project using Python and OpenCV.

## How It Works
- Loads an input image.
- Converts it to grayscale.
- Applies binary thresholding to detect regions.
- Finds contours and draws them on the image.

## Requirements
- Python
- OpenCV

## Run the Project
```bash
python image_segmentation.py
```

## Output
It will display and save an image with detected segments outlined.
